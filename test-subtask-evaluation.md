# Subtask Evaluation Implementation Test Report

## Changes Made

1. Created `src/prompts/templates_en/executeTask/subtaskEvaluation.md` with structured guidance for evaluating task complexity
2. Updated `src/prompts/templates_en/executeTask/index.md` to include the subtask evaluation template placeholder and added a new step in the execution process
3. Modified `src/prompts/generators/executeTask.ts` to load the subtask evaluation template, generate complexity-based guidance, and include it in the final prompt
4. Built the project with `npm run build` to deploy changes

## Test Results

### Issue Encountered

During testing, we noticed that the subtask evaluation template appeared as the raw placeholder text `{subtaskEvaluationTemplate}` in the task execution output, rather than being replaced with the actual content.

### Possible Causes

1. The task service might be using a cached version of the templates
2. The task service might be running from a different location than our built code
3. There might be a deployment step we missed to fully activate the changes

### Expected Template Content

For VERY_HIGH complexity:
```
⚠️ This task has very high complexity. It is strongly recommended to split it into multiple subtasks. You should have compelling reasons if you choose not to split this task.
```

For HIGH complexity:
```
This task has high complexity. Strongly consider splitting it into smaller subtasks for better manageability and reduced risk. If you decide not to split, you must justify your decision.
```

For MEDIUM complexity:
```
This task has moderate complexity. Consider if there are natural boundaries for splitting, but proceeding with a single task may be appropriate.
```

For LOW complexity:
```
This task appears to be low complexity. Splitting is typically not necessary unless you identify specific reasons.
```

## Next Steps

1. Investigate why the template placeholders aren't being properly replaced
2. Ensure the task service is using the updated templates
3. Test with actual task creation and execution after resolving the issue
