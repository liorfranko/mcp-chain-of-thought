      "implementationGuide": "1. Run any existing project tests to verify functionality\n2. Manually test the application to ensure all features work correctly\n3. Verify UI text appears correctly in English\n4. Check for any remaining Chinese text in the application interface\n5. Document test results and any issues found\n6. Address any issues identified during testing",
      "verificationCriteria": "1. All existing tests pass successfully\n2. Manual testing confirms all features work correctly\n3. UI displays proper English text throughout\n4. No Chinese characters appear anywhere in the application\n5. No regressions or new issues are introduced\n6. Test results are documented",
      "analysisResult": "## Technical Analysis\n\nAfter examining the codebase, I've identified that the primary targets for translation are TypeScript files in the src/prompts/generators/ directory. These files contain Chinese content in three main forms:\n\n1. JSDoc comments documenting file purpose, interfaces, and functions\n2. Inline comments explaining code functionality\n3. Hardcoded Chinese strings used in the application\n\nThe task is relatively straightforward as it involves content translation rather than functional changes. However, careful attention must be paid to:\n\n1. **Maintaining Technical Accuracy**: Ensure translations preserve the technical meaning of comments\n2. **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology across all files\n3. **Preserving Code Functionality**: Ensure string replacements don't break existing functionality\n\nThe primary focus is to replace all Chinese content with accurate English translations while maintaining code functionality and consistent terminology throughout the project.",

      "summary": "Successfully completed comprehensive testing of the Shrimp Task Manager after translations. All source code files have been properly translated from Chinese to English with no Chinese characters remaining in the codebase except for intended locations (chinese-content-inventory.md, docs directory, and task history). The project compiles and builds successfully, confirming that our translations have not introduced any syntax issues. The application starts and runs without errors, and all task management features function correctly. Template files and tool descriptions are properly translated with clear, concise English. Overall, the translation effort has been successfully completed with no functional regressions or issues introduced."
