# Update Project Rules Task

## Task Summary
This task involves updating the project rules and specification based on completed tasks to ensure the documentation reflects the current state of the project.

## Preparation

1. **Review Completed Tasks**
   - Gather all completed tasks and their summaries
   - Review implementation details and key decisions made
   - Note any architectural changes or patterns that emerged

2. **Identify Key Information**
   - Technical decisions and their rationale
   - Design patterns and coding conventions established
   - Integration patterns and component relationships
   - Performance optimizations
   - Error handling strategies
   - Security considerations
   - Testing approaches

## Execution Steps

1. **Analyze Project Rules**
   - Identify which parts of the project specification need updating
   - Check for any inconsistencies with implemented solutions

2. **Extract Patterns**
   - Look for recurring patterns in the implementations
   - Document standardized approaches used across components

3. **Document Architectural Decisions**
   - Update architectural diagrams if necessary
   - Document any changes to the system design
   - Record rationale for significant technical decisions

4. **Review Documentation**
   - Update README files and other documentation
   - Ensure API documentation reflects current implementation
   - Update usage examples with current patterns

5. **Formalize Project Rules**
   - Update coding standards based on implemented conventions
   - Document naming conventions that emerged during implementation
   - Define component boundaries and interaction patterns

## Best Practices

- Focus on extracting reusable patterns that apply to future development
- Document the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"
- Include enough context for new contributors to understand the rationale
- Reference specific tasks where key decisions were made
- Use concrete examples from the codebase
- Keep documentation concise but comprehensive

## Expected Outputs

- Updated project specifications that reflect the current state
- Updated architectural documentation
- Formalized coding standards and conventions
- Clear guidance for future development work

## Project Rules Update Completion

Once the project rules are updated, make sure to:
1. Test any documentation code examples
2. Verify the documentation is accessible to team members
3. Complete this task to mark the project phase as completed
