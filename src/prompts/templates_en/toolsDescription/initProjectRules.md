Initialize project rules. Call this tool when the user requests to generate or initialize the project specification file, or if the user requests to change or update the project specification. This tool is particularly useful when executing the "Update Project Rules" task that is automatically added as the final task in the task list, which is intended to reflect the architectural decisions and patterns that emerged during implementation.
