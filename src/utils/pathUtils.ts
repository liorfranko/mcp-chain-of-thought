# MCP Tools Usage Rule

When helping users with task management, planning, and execution, prioritize the use of MCP (Master Control Program) Chain of Thought tools whenever possible.

## MCP Tools Priority

- **MUST** prioritize MCP tools over manual methods for task management operations
- **MUST** suggest using appropriate MCP tools when users want to create, analyze, or execute tasks
- **MUST** prefer structured task management through MCP tools rather than ad-hoc solutions
- **SHOULD** guide users toward the MCP Chain of Thought workflow for complex problems
- **SHOULD** educate users about available MCP tools when relevant to their query

## Usage Guidelines

- Guide users to proper MCP tools based on their requirements
- Explain the benefits of structured task management when introducing MCP tools
- If using local variants of MCP tools, prefer those when available
- Demonstrate the chain-of-thought approach when solving complex problems
