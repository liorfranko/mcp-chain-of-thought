Splitting is typically not necessary unless you identify specific reasons.\\n\\n### How to Split Tasks\\n\\nIf you determine that splitting is necessary:\\n\\n1. Identify logical boundaries for subtasks\\n2. Ensure each subtask is independently executable\\n3. Define clear dependencies between subtasks\\n4. Use the `split_tasks` tool to create the subtasks with:\\n   - Clear individual descriptions\\n   - Defined dependencies between subtasks\\n   - Proper sequencing for execution\\n\\nDocument your evaluation conclusion before proceeding with task execution or splitting. \\n\\n## Execution Steps\\n\\n1. **Evaluate Task Complexity** - Assess if this task should be split into subtasks\\n2. **Analyze Requirements** - Understand task requirements and constraints\\n3. **Design Solution** - Develop implementation plan and testing strategy\\n4. **Implement Solution** - Execute according to plan, handle edge cases\\n5. **Test and Verify** - Ensure functional correctness and robustness\\n\\n## Quality Requirements\\n\\n- **Scope Management** - Only modify relevant code, avoid feature creep\\n- **Code Quality** - Comply with coding standards, handle exceptions\\n- **Performance Consideration** - Pay attention to algorithm efficiency and resource usage\\n\\nStart executing the task according to instructions.

The model functions (loadTasksFromMemory and listMemoryFiles) are exported from taskModel.ts, the schema definitions and wrapper functions are added to taskTools.ts, and the prompt generator functions (getListMemoryFilesPrompt and getLoadTasksFromMemoryPrompt) are exported from prompts/index.ts. This ensures that the new memory loading functionality is properly exposed to the rest of the application, following the same pattern used for other similar functions in the codebase."

Splitting is typically not necessary unless you identify specific reasons.\\n\\n### How to Split Tasks\\n\\nIf you determine that splitting is necessary:\\n\\n1. Identify logical boundaries for subtasks\\n2. Ensure each subtask is independently executable\\n3. Define clear dependencies between subtasks\\n4. Use the `split_tasks` tool to create the subtasks with:\\n   - Clear individual descriptions\\n   - Defined dependencies between subtasks\\n   - Proper sequencing for execution\\n\\nDocument your evaluation conclusion before proceeding with task execution or splitting. \\n\\n## Execution Steps\\n\\n1. **Evaluate Task Complexity** - Assess if this task should be split into subtasks\\n2. **Analyze Requirements** - Understand task requirements and constraints\\n3. **Design Solution** - Develop implementation plan and testing strategy\\n4. **Implement Solution** - Execute according to plan, handle edge cases\\n5. **Test and Verify** - Ensure functional correctness and robustness\\n\\n## Quality Requirements\\n\\n- **Scope Management** - Only modify relevant code, avoid feature creep\\n- **Code Quality** - Comply with coding standards, handle exceptions\\n- **Performance Consideration** - Pay attention to algorithm efficiency and resource usage\\n\\nStart executing the task according to instructions. After execution, please directly use the \\\"verify_task\\\" tool for verification.\\n\"}]}",
