      "analysisResult": "The project requires a comprehensive replacement of all Chinese text with English across the entire codebase. The process begins with a regex-based search to identify all Chinese characters, ensuring no area is missed. The findings are categorized into documentation/HTML, code comments, user-facing strings, i18n/localization files, and memory/data files. For each category, the approach is as follows: (1) Documentation and HTML: Translate all visible Chinese text and comments to clear, idiomatic English, ensuring technical accuracy and readability. (2) Code comments: Rewrite in English, preserving the original technical meaning and context. (3) User-facing strings in JS: Translate all UI strings, test in the application to verify correct display and context, and ensure no untranslated text remains. (4) i18n/localization files: Provide English equivalents for all keys, set English as the default language, and ensure the localization system is robust for future language additions. (5) Memory/data files: Only translate if they are part of the user experience or documentation; otherwise, leave as-is for internal use. Automated tools may be used for initial translation, but manual review is essential for accuracy and context. After all translations, run automated and manual tests to ensure the application remains fully functional and user-friendly. Document the translation process and any changes made for future maintainers. Acceptance criteria: No Chinese text remains in the codebase, all translations are contextually accurate, code functionality is preserved, and the application is fully usable in English.",
      "notes": "Progress update: The majority of visible Chinese text and comments in docs/index.html have been translated to clear, idiomatic English, including meta tags, navigation, section headings, alt text, and user-facing content. The file is now nearly fully translated up to line 1900. Task is not yet complete and can be run again for further updates or additional files.",
