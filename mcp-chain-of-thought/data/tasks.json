Documentation is consistent with the implementation\\n\\n\\n## Analysis Background\\n\\nAfter analyzing the codebase, I've developed a clear implementation plan for automatically adding a project rules update task to every task list created.\\n\\nThe core implementation requires modifying the `splitTasks` function in `src/tools/taskTools.ts` to add a project rules update task after the `convertedTasks` array is created but before calling `batchCreateOrUpdateTasks`.\\n\\nThe project rules update task will:\\n- Be named \\\"Update Project Rules Based on Completed Items\\\"\\n- Have a description explaining its purpose\\n- Include implementation steps based on the existing template\\n- Have dependencies on all other tasks in the batch to ensure it runs last\\n\\nThis ensures project rules are always updated as the final step in any task sequence, maintaining accurate documentation of the project state.\\n\\n\\n## Dependency Task Completion Summaries\\n\\n{{ dependencyTasks }}\\n\\n\\n## Related Files\\n\\nYou can use the `update_task` tool to add related files to provide context during task execution.\\n\\nThe current task has no related files.\\n\\n\\n## Task Complexity Assessment\\n\\n- **Complexity Level:** Low Complexity\\n\\n\\n\\n### Assessment Metrics\\n\\n- Description Length: 167 characters\\n\\n- Number of Dependencies: 1\\n\\n### Handling Recommendations\\n\\n- This task is low complexity, can be executed directly\\n- Suggest setting clear completion standards, ensuring acceptance has clear basis\\n\\n\\n\\n## Subtask Evaluation\\n\\n⚠️ **IMPORTANT: You MUST complete this evaluation step before proceeding** ⚠️\\n\\n### Assessment Criteria\\n\\nBased on the complexity assessment of this task, determine if it should be split into smaller subtasks:\\n\\n1. **Task Size Evaluation**:\\n   - Is the task description unusually long and detailed?\\n   - Does the task involve multiple distinct components or features?\\n   - Would the implementation require changes to multiple parts of the codebase?\\n\\n2. **Scope Boundaries**:\\n   - Are there natural boundaries where the task can be divided?\\n   - Can independent modules or features be identified?\\n   - Could multiple people work on different parts simultaneously?\\n\\n3. **Risk Management**:\\n   - Would failures in one part of the task endanger the entire implementation?\\n   - Would splitting the task make testing and verification more manageable?\\n   - Would smaller subtasks reduce the overall complexity and risk?\\n\\n### Decision Process\\n\\nThis task appears to be low complexity. Splitting is typically not necessary unless you identify specific reasons.\\n\\n### How to Split Tasks\\n\\nIf you determine that splitting is necessary:\\n\\n1. Identify logical boundaries for subtasks\\n2. Ensure each subtask is independently executable\\n3. Define clear dependencies between subtasks\\n4. Use the `split_tasks` tool to create the subtasks with:\\n   - Clear individual descriptions\\n   - Defined dependencies between subtasks\\n   - Proper sequencing for execution\\n\\nDocument your evaluation conclusion before proceeding with task execution or splitting. \\n\\n## Execution Steps\\n\\n1. **Evaluate Task Complexity** - Assess if this task should be split into subtasks\\n2. **Analyze Requirements** - Understand task requirements and constraints\\n3. **Design Solution** - Develop implementation plan and testing strategy\\n4. **Implement Solution** - Execute according to plan, handle edge cases\\n5. **Test and Verify** - Ensure functional correctness and robustness\\n\\n## Quality Requirements\\n\\n- **Scope Management** - Only modify relevant code, avoid feature creep\\n- **Code Quality** - Comply with coding standards, handle exceptions\\n- **Performance Consideration** - Pay attention to algorithm efficiency and resource usage\\n\\nStart executing the task according to instructions. After execution, please directly use the \\\"verify_task\\\" tool for verification.\\n\"}]}",
