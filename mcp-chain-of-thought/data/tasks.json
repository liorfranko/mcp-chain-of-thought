Splitting is typically not necessary unless you identify specific reasons.\\n\\n### How to Split Tasks\\n\\nIf you determine that splitting is necessary:\\n\\n1. Identify logical boundaries for subtasks\\n2. Ensure each subtask is independently executable\\n3. Define clear dependencies between subtasks\\n4. Use the `split_tasks` tool to create the subtasks with:\\n   - Clear individual descriptions\\n   - Defined dependencies between subtasks\\n   - Proper sequencing for execution\\n\\nDocument your evaluation conclusion before proceeding with task execution or splitting. \\n\\n## Execution Steps\\n\\n1. **Evaluate Task Complexity** - Assess if this task should be split into subtasks\\n2. **Analyze Requirements** - Understand task requirements and constraints\\n3. **Design Solution** - Develop implementation plan and testing strategy\\n4. **Implement Solution** - Execute according to plan, handle edge cases\\n5. **Test and Verify** - Ensure functional correctness and robustness\\n\\n## Quality Requirements\\n\\n- **Scope Management** - Only modify relevant code, avoid feature creep\\n- **Code Quality** - Comply with coding standards, handle exceptions\\n- **Performance Consideration** - Pay attention to algorithm efficiency and resource usage\\n\\nStart executing the task according to instructions.
